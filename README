JIRA Issue dashlet for Alfresco Share
====================================

Author: Simon Buckle

This dashlet displays a user's unresolved JIRA issues that are either overdue or are due shortly.

Installation 
------------

The dashlet has been developed to work on Alfresco 3.4. 
It has been tested with JIRA 4.4.

A build script is provided and is taken directly from the sample project:
http://code.google.com/p/share-extras/wiki/SampleProject

To build the dashlet and have the packaged JAR file deployed directly to your Tomcat instance, set the property 'tomcat.home' as appropriate and then run the following command: ant -Dtomcat.home=/Applications/alfresco-3.4.d/tomcat/ clean hotcopy-tomcat-jar

Alternatively, to build an AMP file run the following the command: ant dist-amp

Configuration
-------------

The dashlet defines a custom endpoint (share-config-custom.xml) that is used to connect to JIRA. This will need to modified so that the endpoint url points to REST API of your instance of JIRA. A username and password will also need to be set; the user will need to have the appropriate permissions to be able to access JIRA.

The property 'jira-url' in the configuration file for the dashlet (jira-issues.get.config.xml) will also need to be set to URL of your JIRA instance; this property is used to create a link to the issue within JIRA.

That should be it!
